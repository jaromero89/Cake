Purpose:  The purpose of this applications is to store family information suchas first name, last name, age, gender and birth date, with maybe* the option ofuploading their photo. This will allow the user to have access to his familysâ€™ pertinentinformation. For example, Sam is a  35 years old man who has three brothers, two sisters andalso has three children of his own. Each of his siblings has two or more children. In order forSam to plan and remember each of his nieces and nephews birthdays, he will utilize theapplication to help store all of the families' information. As a man who dislikes social media, heis happy with the convenience of this application.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

If you don't have bootstrap and jquery, please download it on the official

To make sure node.js is already installed on your computer, please open a terminal or Command Line / Command Prompt.
And then type the following command:
node -v

The output will provide you with the latest version.
After that, also check NPM (Node Package Manager) by typing the following command:

Open your browser, then type the url below:

http://localhost:8000

### Break down into end to end tests

In built and installed properly the webpage should be displayed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to this being a web application which is connected to MYSQL
you may need to match up the ip address as well as any other pertinant information
that is necessary..ie database or tables.

## Deployment

Test the application to make sure the crud application that we create runs well.
To run the application, type the following command on the terminal.
